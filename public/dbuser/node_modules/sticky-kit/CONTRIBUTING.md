# Contributing to Sticky-Kit


Thanks for reporting an issue. Sticky-kit is actually pretty complicated and
handles a lot of sticky scenarios. If the issue isn't immediately obvious when
written in text then you must include a minimal case example of the problem on
<http://jsfiddle.net/> or something similar to help save us some time.

If you're opening a pull request, remember Sticky-kit is written in
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), so you should be applying your patch
to the CoffeeScript file and not the JavaScript files. Don't worry about
building/minifying the JS files, I'm glad to do it for you. In any case, you
can see how it's done in the
[Makefile](https://github.com/leafo/sticky-kit/blob/master/Makefile).

Thanks
